## 👋 About Me

Hi, I’m **Parth Manekar**, a final-year **Electronics & Telecommunication Engineering** student at **PICT Pune (SPPU)** with a strong focus on **AI/ML, Deep Learning, and Generative AI systems**.

I enjoy building **real-world, production-aware ML systems** where **performance, reliability, and deployment constraints** matter. My work spans **computer vision, network intelligence, time-series prediction, and applied Generative AI**, with multiple projects accepted for **Springer LNNS publications**.
